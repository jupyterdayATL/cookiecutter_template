# ## Experience Documentation
# 
# TODO: Summarize important experience gained during the project. For example, pitfalls, misleading approaches,
# or hints for selecting the best suited data mining techniques in similar situations could be part of this
# documentation. In ideal projects, experience documentation also covers any reports that have been
# written by individual project members during previous phases of the project.
