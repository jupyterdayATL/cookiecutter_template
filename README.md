    * Product Service Engineer(s)
    * Customer Representatives

## Metrics
* What are the qualitative objectives? (e.g. Detect gas turbine bearing rubs during shutdown.)
* What is a quantifiable metric  (Detect bearing rubs during shutdown with a POD of 90% and a FPR of < 1%)
* Quantify what improvement in the values of the metrics are useful for the customer scenario (e.g. reduce the number of alarms of analytic X by 25%)
* What is the baseline (current) value of the metric?
* How will we measure the metric? 

## Plan
* Phases (milestones), timeline, short description of what we'll do in each phase.

## Architecture
* Data
  * What data do we expect? Raw data in the customer data sources (e.g. on-prem files, SQL databases, Historian, etc)
* Data movement from on-prem to to cloud 
  * all the data, 
  * after some pre-aggregation on-prem,
  * Sampled data enough for modeling
* What tools and data storage/analytics resources will be used in the solution e.g.,
  * Hive/R/Python for feature construction, aggregation and sampling
  * i.e. Orchestration Manager for operationalizing, Tableau for dashboard visualization
  * How will the end customer use the model results to make decisions

## Communication
* How will we keep in touch? Weekly meetings?
* Who are the contact persons?
